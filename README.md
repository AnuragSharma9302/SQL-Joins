# ðŸ“Š SQL Joins 

This repository is designed to **practice SQL joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, and SELF JOIN)** using a simple **Products & Orders** database. It is compatible with **PostgreSQL** and can be run on tools like **pgAdmin4,  or DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

* **schema.sql** â†’ Contains database schema (tables + relationships).
* **data.sql** â†’ Contains sample data for testing joins.
* **queries.sql** â†’ Contains 20 SQL queries using different types of joins.
* **README.md** â†’ Project overview, join explanations, and documentation.
* **ER Diagram** â†’ Shows relationship between `Products` and `Orders` (One Product â†’ Many Orders).




## ðŸ”‘ SQL Join Types Explained

* **INNER JOIN** â†’ Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
* **LEFT JOIN** â†’ Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table; unmatched rows from the right appear as NULL.
* **RIGHT JOIN** â†’ Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table; unmatched rows from the left appear as NULL.
* **FULL JOIN** â†’ Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables, filling unmatched parts with NULLs.
* **SELF JOIN** â†’ Joins a table with itself, useful for comparing rows within the same table.

## ðŸ§ª Learning Objectives

* Understand **table relationships** (foreign keys).
* Master **INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, and SELF JOINS**.
* Learn to calculate **aggregations, groupings, and conditions** with joins.

## ðŸš€ Example Query

```sql
-- Show total revenue per order
SELECT o.OrderID, SUM(o.Quantity * p.Price) AS OrderRevenue
FROM Products p
RIGHT JOIN Orders o ON p.ProductID = o.ProductID
GROUP BY o.OrderID;
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome

âœ… Understanding of SQL joins.

âœ… Understanding of merging data across multiple tables.

âœ… Being able to explain practical scenarios of joins in interviews.
